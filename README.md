# Game Logic
At the beginning of the game, 7 cards are dealt to each player and 3 face down
cards are placed in front of each player.
Players choose 3 cards among the 7 cards in their hands and place the 3 cards they
chose face up on the 3 face down cards.
Set of 3 open and 3 closed cards are cannot be played until the cards in the deck
and the player's hand are finished.
Players start the game with the remaining 4 cards in their hands, the player who will
start the game puts a card of his/her choice in the middle of the table “Play ground”
and draws a card from the deck to complete the cards in his/her hand to four.
The next player must respond with a higher card than the last played card on the
“play ground” (If next player cannot respond the card on the “play ground”, player
must take all the cards on the “play ground”)
•⁠ ⁠Note: Players cannot draw cards from the deck IF they have more than 3 cards on
their hands.
•⁠ ⁠Note: During their turn to play, players can choose to take cards on the "play field"
even they able to respond to the card on the "play field".
•⁠ ⁠Note: IF the player takes the cards from the “play ground”, he/she cannot play card
on that round and the turn to play passes to the next player.
After running out of cards in the deck, players try to get rid of the cards in their
hands. The player who has no cards left in his/her hand takes 3 face up cards that
he/she placed on top of the face down cards at the beginning of the game.
After players take 3 open cards on the table, they try to get rid of the cards in their
hands (again). The player who has no card left (again), can play 3 closed card
•⁠ ⁠Note: players cannot check what’s under the close cards they have to play
randomly IF they cannot respond to card on the “play ground” they took the cards on
the ground and they cannot play rest of the closed card until get rid of card on their
hands
The first player who get rid of all his/her cards

!!! Wins The Game !!!
